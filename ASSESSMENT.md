# Initial Assessment Questions üìù

Welcome! Before we begin your algorithms journey, let's assess your current Java and algorithmic knowledge. This will help tailor the learning experience to your level.

## Instructions

Please answer the following 3 questions thoughtfully. There are no "wrong" answers - this assessment helps determine the best starting point for your learning path.

**Time Limit**: Take as much time as you need, but aim to complete within 30 minutes.

## Question 1: Java Syntax & Object-Oriented Programming üèóÔ∏è

**Scenario**: You need to create a class to represent a `Student` with the following requirements:
- Each student has a `name` (String) and `age` (int)
- Students can be compared by age for sorting
- The class should be immutable (values cannot be changed after creation)
- Include a method to get student information as a formatted string

**Task**: Write the complete Java class implementation.

**Your Answer**:
```java
// Write your Student class here
```

## Question 2: Basic Algorithm Concepts & Big O Notation üìä

**Problem**: Given an array of integers, find the two numbers that add up to a target value.

**Example**:
- Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
- Output: `[0, 1]` (because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`)

**Constraints**:
- Array length: `2 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10^4`
- Each number: `-10^9 ‚â§ nums[i] ‚â§ 10^9`
- Target: `-10^9 ‚â§ target ‚â§ 10^9`
- Only one valid solution exists

**Tasks**:
1. **Describe your approach** (2-3 sentences)
2. **What is the time complexity** of your solution?
3. **What is the space complexity** of your solution?
4. **Write the Java method signature** (you don't need to implement the full solution)

**Your Answer**:
```
Approach: 
[Describe your strategy here]

Time Complexity: O(___)
Space Complexity: O(___)

Method Signature:
[Write your method signature here]
```

## Question 3: Data Structure Selection & Problem-Solving Thinking üß†

**Scenario**: You're building a system to track the frequency of words in a document. You need to:
1. Count how many times each word appears
2. Find the most frequent word
3. Get all words that appear exactly twice
4. Handle case-insensitive matching

**Question**: Which data structure would you choose and why? Consider both time and space efficiency.

**Options to consider**:
- Array
- ArrayList
- HashMap
- HashSet
- TreeMap
- Other (specify)

**Your Answer**:
```
Primary Data Structure: [Your choice]

Reasoning:
[Explain why this data structure is best for this problem, considering:
- Time complexity for each operation
- Space complexity
- Ease of implementation
- Any trade-offs you considered]

Alternative approaches considered:
[If you considered other options, briefly explain why you didn't choose them]
```
