# Week 4: Linked Lists 🔗

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Manipulate singly and doubly linked lists
- Apply fast and slow pointer techniques
- Detect cycles in linked lists
- Reverse linked lists efficiently
- Handle edge cases in list operations

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. Linked List Fundamentals
- **Singly linked**: Single direction traversal
- **Doubly linked**: Bidirectional traversal
- **Node structure**: Data and pointer(s)
- **Time complexity**: O(n) for most operations

### 2. Pointer Techniques
- **Fast and slow pointers**: Cycle detection
- **Two pointers**: Finding middle, nth from end
- **Multiple pointers**: Complex manipulations
- **Time complexity**: O(n) with O(1) space

### 3. List Manipulation
- **Reversal**: Iterative and recursive approaches
- **Merging**: Combining sorted lists
- **Partitioning**: Splitting based on conditions
- **Time complexity**: O(n) for most operations
