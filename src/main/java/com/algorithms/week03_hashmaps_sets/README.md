# Week 3: Hash Maps & Sets 🗂️

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Use HashMap for efficient lookups
- Apply HashSet for duplicate detection
- Implement frequency counting patterns
- Handle hash collisions
- Choose appropriate hash-based data structures

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. Hash Tables
- **HashMap**: Key-value storage with O(1) average access
- **HashSet**: Unique element storage
- **Collision handling**: Chaining, open addressing
- **Time complexity**: O(1) average, O(n) worst case

### 2. Frequency Counting
- **Pattern**: Count occurrences of elements
- **Applications**: Anagrams, duplicates, statistics
- **Implementation**: HashMap with counts
- **Time complexity**: O(n) for counting

### 3. Set Operations
- **Union, intersection, difference**
- **Subset/superset checking**
- **Duplicate removal**
- **Time complexity**: O(n) for most operations

## 🛠️ Java Implementation

*Implementation details will be added when you reach this topic*

## 🎯 Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Valid Anagram (Easy)
**LeetCode #242** - Check if two strings are anagrams

### Problem 2: Group Anagrams (Medium)
**LeetCode #49** - Group strings that are anagrams

### Problem 3: Longest Consecutive Sequence (Medium)
**LeetCode #128** - Find longest consecutive sequence
