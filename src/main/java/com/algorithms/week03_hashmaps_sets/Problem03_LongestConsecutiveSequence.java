/**
 * Problem 3: Longest Consecutive Sequence
 * 
 * LeetCode #128 - Medium
 * 
 * Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
 * 
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * - 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
 * Output: 9
 * 
 * Follow-up: Your algorithm should run in O(n) time.
