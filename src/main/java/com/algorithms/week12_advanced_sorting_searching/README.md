# Week 12: Advanced Sorting & Searching 🔍

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Implement advanced sorting algorithms
- Apply binary search variations
- Optimize search space efficiently
- Handle complex search problems
- Choose appropriate sorting/searching techniques

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. Advanced Sorting
- **Quick sort**: Divide and conquer with partitioning
- **Merge sort**: Stable sorting with O(n log n)
- **Heap sort**: In-place sorting using heaps
- **Time complexity**: O(n log n) average/best case

### 2. Binary Search Variations
- **Standard binary search**: Find exact value
- **Lower/upper bound**: Find insertion points
- **Rotated arrays**: Search in rotated sorted array
- **Time complexity**: O(log n)

### 3. Search Space Optimization
- **Two pointers**: Reduce search space
- **Binary search on answer**: When answer is monotonic
- **Meet in the middle**: Split search space
- **Time complexity**: Often O(log n) to O(n)
