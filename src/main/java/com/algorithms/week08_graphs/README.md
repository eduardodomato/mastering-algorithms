# Week 8: Graphs 🕸️

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Represent graphs using different data structures
- Implement DFS and BFS traversal
- Apply shortest path algorithms
- Find minimum spanning trees
- Choose appropriate graph algorithms

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. Graph Representations
- **Adjacency list**: Space efficient for sparse graphs
- **Adjacency matrix**: Fast lookup for dense graphs
- **Edge list**: Simple representation
- **Time complexity**: Varies by representation

### 2. Graph Traversal
- **DFS**: Depth-first search using recursion/stack
- **BFS**: Breadth-first search using queue
- **Applications**: Path finding, cycle detection
- **Time complexity**: O(V + E)

### 3. Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Dijkstra**: Single source shortest path
- **Bellman-Ford**: Handles negative weights
- **Floyd-Warshall**: All pairs shortest path
- **Time complexity**: O(V²) to O(V³)
