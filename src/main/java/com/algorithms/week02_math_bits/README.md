# Week 2: Basic Math & Bit Manipulation 🔢

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Apply mathematical algorithms to solve problems
- Use bitwise operations effectively
- Understand number theory basics
- Implement prime number algorithms
- Analyze mathematical complexity

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. Mathematical Algorithms
- **GCD/LCM**: Greatest common divisor, least common multiple
- **Factorials**: Large number handling
- **Powers**: Exponentiation, modular arithmetic
- **Time complexity**: Varies by algorithm

### 2. Bit Manipulation
- **Bitwise operations**: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, shifts
- **Common patterns**: Set/clear bits, count bits
- **Bit masks**: Extracting specific bits
- **Time complexity**: O(1) for most operations

### 3. Number Theory
- **Prime numbers**: Sieve of Eratosthenes
- **Divisors**: Finding factors efficiently
- **Modular arithmetic**: Properties and applications
- **Time complexity**: O(sqrt(n)) for basic operations
