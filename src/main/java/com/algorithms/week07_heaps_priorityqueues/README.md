# Week 7: Heaps & Priority Queues ⚡

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:
- Implement min and max heaps
- Use priority queues for optimization
- Solve top K problems efficiently
- Apply heap-based sorting
- Choose appropriate heap operations

## 📚 Core Concepts

### 1. Heap Properties
- **Min heap**: Parent ≤ children
- **Max heap**: Parent ≥ children
- **Complete binary tree**: All levels filled left to right
- **Time complexity**: O(log n) for insert/delete

### 2. Priority Queue
- **Java implementation**: PriorityQueue class
- **Custom comparators**: Min/max heap behavior
- **Applications**: Dijkstra's algorithm, scheduling
- **Time complexity**: O(log n) for operations

### 3. Top K Problems
- **Pattern**: Maintain heap of size K
- **Applications**: Largest/smallest elements
- **Optimization**: Reduce space complexity
- **Time complexity**: O(n log k)

## 🛠️ Java Implementation
