# Mastering Algorithms: Java Edition üöÄ

Welcome to your comprehensive Java algorithms learning journey! This curriculum is designed to prepare you for technical interviews and competitive programming on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.

üì¢ This project was created using Cursor AI IDE and is designed to evolve dynamically as you progress through your learning journey. Here's how it works:

### For Cursor Users (Recommended Path)
- **Start from the `main` branch** - This contains the foundational structure ready for Week 1
- **Ask the Cursor Agent** to generate subsequent weeks as you complete each one
- **Learn step-by-step** - This approach encourages weekly progression and prevents overwhelming yourself with too much content at once

### For Non-Cursor Users
- **Use the `full-course` branch** - This contains all exercises from Week 1-12
- **Complete freedom** to work through the entire curriculum at your own pace
- **All content available** without needing AI assistance

**Happy coding and learning! Eduardo.**

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this curriculum, you will be able to:
- **Autonomously solve medium-level problems** from LeetCode/HackerRank within 30-45 minutes
- **Master core data structures** and algorithmic paradigms
- **Think systematically** about problem-solving approaches
- **Write clean, efficient Java code** following best practices
- **Analyze time and space complexity** (Big O notation)
